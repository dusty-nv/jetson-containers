[`Home Assistant`](https://www.home-assistant.io/) add-on that uses [`wyoming-satellite`](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-satellite) for remote voice [satellite](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wyoming#satellites) using the [`wyoming` protocol](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wyoming/) on **NVIDIA Jetson** devices. Thank you to [**@ms1design**](https://github.com/ms1design) for contributing these Home Assistant & Wyoming containers!

## Features

- [x] Works well with [`home-assistant-core`](/packages/smart-home/homeassistant-core) container on **Jetson devices** as well as Home Assistant hosted on different hosts
- [x] Uses the [`wyoming-openwakeword`](/packages/smart-home/wyoming/openwakeword) container to detect wake words
- [x] Uses the [`wyoming-whisper`](/packages/smart-home/wyoming/wyoming-whisper) container to handle `STT`
- [x] Uses the [`wyoming-piper`](/packages/smart-home/wyoming/piper) container to handle `TTS`

> Requires **Home Assistant** `2023.9` or later.

## `docker-compose` example

If you want to use `docker compose` to run [Home Assistant Core](/packages/smart-home/homeassistant-core/) [Voice Assistant Pipeline](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/) on a **Jetson** device with `cuda` enabled, you can find a full example [`docker-compose.yaml` here](/packages/smart-home/wyoming/docker-compose.yaml).

### Determine Audio Devices

Picking the correct microphone/speaker devices is critical for the satellite to work.

List your available microphones with:
```bash
arecord -L
```

List your available speakers with:
```bash
aplay -L
```

You should see similar output to below for both commands:
```bash
plughw:CARD=seeed2micvoicec,DEV=0
    seeed-2mic-voicecard, bcm2835-i2s-wm8960-hifi wm8960-hifi-0
    Hardware device with all software conversions
```

Prefer ones that start with `plughw:` or just use `default` if you don't know what to use. It's recommended to choose Microphone and Speaker which has `Hardware device with all software conversions` notation. Set the environment variable `SATELLITE_AUDIO_DEVICE` to:

```bash
plughw:CARD=seeed2micvoicec,DEV=0
```

> `wyoming-assist-microphone` uses the same device for Mic as Speaker.

## TODO's

- [ ] Investigate whether the user should see the transcription of voice commands and responses in the Home Assistant Assist Chat popup when the name of the conversational pipeline is passed as `ASSIST_PIPELINE_NAME`.
- [ ] Split `SATELLITE_AUDIO_DEVICE` into `SATELLITE_MIC_DEVICE` and `SATELLITE_SND_DEVICE` to allow selection of different audio hardware combinations.

<summary><b><a id="run">RUN CONTAINER</a></b></summary>
<br>

To start the container, you can use [`jetson-containers run`](/docs/run.md) and [`autotag`](/docs/run.md#autotag), or manually put together a [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command:
```bash
# automatically pull or build a compatible container image
jetson-containers run $(autotag assist-microphone)

# or if using 'docker run' (specify image and mounts/ect)
sudo docker run --runtime nvidia -it --rm --network=host assist-microphone:35.2.1

```
> <sup>[`jetson-containers run`](/docs/run.md) forwards arguments to [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) with some defaults added (like `--runtime nvidia`, mounts a `/data` cache, and detects devices)</sup><br>
> <sup>[`autotag`](/docs/run.md#autotag) finds a container image that's compatible with your version of JetPack/L4T - either locally, pulled from a registry, or by building it.</sup>

To mount your own directories into the container, use the [`-v`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#volume) or [`--volume`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#volume) flags:
```bash
jetson-containers run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container $(autotag assist-microphone)
```
To launch the container running a command, as opposed to an interactive shell:
```bash
jetson-containers run $(autotag assist-microphone) my_app --abc xyz
```
You can pass any options to it that you would to [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/), and it'll print out the full command that it constructs before executing it.

<summary><b><a id="build">BUILD CONTAINER</b></summary>
<br>

If you use [`autotag`](/docs/run.md#autotag) as shown above, it'll ask to build the container for you if needed.  To manually build it, first do the [system setup](/docs/setup.md), then run:
```bash
jetson-containers build assist-microphone
```
The dependencies from above will be built into the container, and it'll be tested during.  Run it with [`--help`](/jetson_containers/build.py) for build options.
