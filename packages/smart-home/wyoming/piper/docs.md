[`Home Assistant`](https://www.home-assistant.io/) add-on that uses [`wyoming-piper`](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-piper) for text-to-speech system using the [`wyoming` protocol](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wyoming/) on **NVIDIA Jetson** devices. Thank you to [**@ms1design**](https://github.com/ms1design) for contributing these Home Assistant & Wyoming containers!

## Features

- [x] Works well with [`home-assistant-core`](packages/smart-home/homeassistant-core) container on **Jetson** devices as well as Home Assistant hosted on different hosts
- [x] `GPU` accelerated on **Jetson** devices thanks to [`piper-tts` container](packages/audio/piper-tts)

> Requires **Home Assistant** `2023.9` or later.

## `docker-compose` example

If you want to use `docker compose` to run [Home Assistant Core](/packages/smart-home/homeassistant-core/) [Voice Assistant Pipeline](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/) on a **Jetson** device with `cuda` enabled, you can find a full example [`docker-compose.yaml` here](/packages/smart-home/wyoming/docker-compose.yaml).
