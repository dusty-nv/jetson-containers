[`Home Assistant`](https://www.home-assistant.io/) add-on that uses [`wyoming-faster-whisper`](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-faster-whisper) for speech-to-text system using the [`wyoming` protocol](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wyoming/) on **NVIDIA Jetson** devices. Thank you to [**@ms1design**](https://github.com/ms1design) for contributing these Home Assistant & Wyoming containers!

## Features

- [x] Works well with [`home-assistant-core`](packages/smart-home/homeassistant-core) container on **Jetson devices** as well as Home Assistant hosted on different hosts
- [x] `GPU` accelerated on **Jetson Devices** thanks to [`faster-whisper` container](packages/audio/faster-whisper)

> Requires **Home Assistant** `2023.9` or later.

## `docker-compose` example

If you want to use `docker compose` to run [Home Assistant Core](/packages/smart-home/homeassistant-core/) [Voice Assistant Pipeline](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/) on a **Jetson** device with `cuda` enabled, you can find a full example [`docker-compose.yaml` here](/packages/smart-home/wyoming/docker-compose.yaml).
