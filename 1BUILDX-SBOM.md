# Docker Image Build, SBOM Generation, and Attestation

This guide provides a step-by-step process to build a Docker image, generate an SBOM using Docker Scout CLI, attach the SBOM to the image, and push it to your Docker repository.
```

## Step 1: Build and Push Docker Image using `docker buildx`

**Set up Docker Buildx Builder:**

If you haven't already set up a builder instance, create one using:
```sh
docker buildx create --name mybuilder --use
```

**Build and Push the Docker Image:**

Use the following command to build and push your Docker image:
```sh
docker buildx build \
  --builder mybuilder \
  --platform linux/arm64 \
  -t kairin/001:2025-03-24-2347 \
  --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=kairin/001:nvcr.io-nvidia-pytorch-25.02-py3-igpu \
  --push \
  .
```

## Step 2: Set Temporary Directory for Docker Scout

**Create a New Temporary Directory:**

Create a directory on a drive with sufficient space, for example:
```sh
mkdir -p /media/kkk/mnt1/tmp
```

**Set the `TMPDIR` Environment Variable:**

Set `TMPDIR` to the new directory:
```sh
export TMPDIR=/media/kkk/mnt1/tmp
```

## Step 3: Generate SBOM using Docker Scout

**Generate the SBOM:**

Run the following command to generate the SBOM for your Docker image:
```sh
docker scout sbom kairin/001:2025-03-24-2347 -o sbom.json
```

## Step 4: Attach the SBOM using Docker Scout CLI

**Attach the SBOM:**

Use the following command to attach the generated SBOM to your Docker image:
```sh
docker scout attestation add --file sbom.json --predicate-type https://spdx.dev/spdx/v2.3 kairin/001:2025-03-24-2347
```

## Step 5: Push the Docker Image with the Attestation

**Push the Docker Image:**

Push the Docker image with the attached SBOM to your repository:
```sh
docker push kairin/001:2025-03-24-2347
```

**Push All Tags (if needed):**

If you want to push all tags, use:
```sh
docker push --all-tags kairin/001
```

By following these steps, you can build, push your Docker image, generate an SBOM, attach it to your image, and push everything to your Docker repository. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
